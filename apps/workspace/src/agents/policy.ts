 *
 * This is *selection*, not enforcement: the policy decides which bound
 * instance a run thinks with before the first token is spent. What each
 * candidate costs and how it should be classed is workspace configuration —
 * an instance's binding `options` may carry `tier` and `costPerMTokUsd`, and
 * both flow through `resolveInterfaceForWorkspace().options` like any other
 * binding option (`model` on `llm`, `image` on `sandbox`). A vendor never
 * declares them; the workspace that bound the instance did.
 *
 * The selector is a pure function so the rules can be unit-tested without a
 * workspace: the `agents` service resolves each candidate's binding into an
 * {@link LlmCandidateMeta} and hands the list here.

 *      the cap can only act on what a binding admits to, and treating silence
 *      as "too expensive" would make an unannotated binding unusable the day
 *      someone sets a cap.
 *   2. **Desired tier** — from `effort` via {@link tierForEffort}; a
 *      `deadlineMs` overrides it to `fast`, because a deadline is a speed
 *      request whatever the effort says.
 *   3. **Nearest tier wins, ties round down** — the same rule as
 *      `nearestEffort`: on a two-tier candidate list the middle of the scale
 *      must not silently become the most expensive setting. Declaration order
 *      breaks remaining ties, so the profile's preference is the tiebreaker.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` when the cost cap excluded everything; the caller falls
 * back to `profile.llm`, then the default `llm` instance.
