/**
 * Library entry point for `@aprovan/workspace`.
 *
 * The package is one thing delivered three ways: `workspace start` on a
 * laptop, `ghcr.io/aprovanlabs/workspace` on ECS, and — via these exports — a
 * server embedded directly in a host process, which is how the desktop app
 * runs the platform without shelling out.
 *
 * To run it as a program, use ./cli.ts.
