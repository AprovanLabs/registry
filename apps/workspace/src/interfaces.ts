/**
 * Generic interfaces — virtual tool namespaces a workspace binds to a
 * concrete provider + credential.
 *
 * Many APIs implement a subset of another (OpenAI-compatible LLM servers,
 * S3-compatible object stores). An *interface* names that common surface
 * (`llm`, `objectstore`, …); *compat entries* list which registry providers
 * implement it and how to reach them (executor module + base URL + option
 * defaults); a *workspace binding* (`.services/bindings.json`) picks the
 * implementation. Callers use one stable namespace —
 *
 *   await llm.createChatCompletion({ messages });
 *
 * — and swapping OpenAI for Anthropic (or Synthetic) is a binding change,
 * not a code change. Credentials stay keyed by the concrete provider id, so
 * the registry credentials page and the gateway credential store line up.
 *
 * Zero-config: with no explicit binding, an interface resolves to the first
 * compat provider that has a workspace credential.
 *
 * ## Instances
 *
 * One binding per interface is enough to answer "which LLM does this
 * workspace use", and not enough for anything else: a workspace with a
 * production database and an analytics warehouse needs *both* bound to `sql`
 * at once, and two accounts on one provider need two credentials. So a
 * binding is keyed by an **instance name**, not by the interface id:
 *
 *   sql              → the default instance (what `sql.query` reaches)
 *   sql:analytics    → a second, independently bound implementation
 *   sql:warehouse    → a third
 *
 * Each instance is (interface, provider, credential, options), and each is a
 * namespace of its own — `sql:analytics.query` appears in tool discovery, in
 * the services menu, and as a workflow script import next to `sql.query`. The
 * bare interface id is reserved as the default instance, which is why the
 * pre-instance bindings file (keyed by interface id, with no `interface`
 * field) reads correctly as-is: it was always describing the default.
