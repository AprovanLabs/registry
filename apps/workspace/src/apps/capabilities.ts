/**
 * What a published app may touch — the whitelisting story, stated once so
 * every surface (publish validation, the app tool proxy, the directory UI, the
 * generated SDK) reads it from the same place instead of hardcoding lists.
 *
 * There are exactly three ways an app reaches data:
 *
 *  1. **Native, auto-partitioned** — {@link NATIVE_APP_NAMESPACES}. First-party
 *     namespaces whose storage is automatically partitioned per (app, app
 *     user) and rate-limited per user. No credential, no workspace membership.
 *  2. **Workspace-credentialed** — a provider namespace (`github`, `linear`, …)
 *     executing with the OWNING workspace's credential. Reachable from an app
 *     session's tool proxy only through an explicit **credential grant**: an
 *     `allowedTools` entry naming one *exact* procedure (`github.repos.get`) —
 *     never a wildcard — for a provider the workspace actually holds a
 *     credential for. `apps.capabilities` reports each grant under this tier.
 *  3. **Exported workflows** — everything else. A workflow is the BFF boundary:
 *     allow-listed by name, traced, rate-limited, and the only place a secret
 *     is ever near an app request. Exported workflows are callable as
 *     `POST /tools/app/<workflow>` — at the call site a workflow and a native
 *     procedure are indistinguishable (capability = namespace).
 *
 * `allowedTools` may therefore name (1), the app's own workflow namespace, and
 * exact provider procedures (2); {@link assertAllowedTools} rejects everything
 * else — a provider *wildcard* in particular — with a message pointing at (3).
