/**
 * The workspace server: one route tree, one lifecycle, every host.
 *
 * There used to be two entry points that disagreed. `index.ts` mounted the API
 * at `/`, `lambda.ts` mounted it at `/api/gateway`, and only the second one was
 * what production served — so every local test of a path-sensitive behaviour
 * (redirects, MCP resource metadata, live app URLs) was testing a layout that
 * did not exist in the deployed system. There is now one tree, defined here,
 * and the CLI, the container, the test suite and an embedding host all serve
 * exactly it:
 *
 *   /api/gateway/*   REST API (credentials, fs, llm, apps, workflows, …)
 *   /api/mcp         public MCP endpoint
 *   /.well-known/*   RFC 9728 OAuth resource metadata, resolved at the root
 *   /apps/*          live app pages (aprovan.com/apps/<workspace>/<name>)
 *   /health          liveness, for container/load-balancer probes
