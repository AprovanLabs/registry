/**
 * The core-service kernel: the contract every core service is written
 * against, and nothing else.
 *
 * This module exists to be a **leaf**. `services.ts` builds `CORE_SERVICES`
 * from the service modules at module-init time, so any symbol those modules
 * need from `services.ts` would close a cycle whose resolution depends on
 * which file the process imported first — real entrypoints happened to load
 * `services.ts` first and worked, while `import("./apps/service.js")` from a
 * script or a focused test crashed with "Cannot access 'appsService' before
 * initialization". Putting the shared contract here removes the back-edge
 * instead of making the order tolerable.
 *
 * The invariant that keeps it that way: **`services.ts` must not export
 * `ServiceError`, `ServiceContext`, or `CoreService`.** With one canonical
 * home there is no import that could re-create the cycle by accident.
 *
 * The two imports below are `import type` and erase at compile time, so they
 * add no runtime edge even though both modules sit downstream of this one.
