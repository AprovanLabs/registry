/**
 * migrate-app-records.ts — one-shot sweep that moves every workspace's
 * FS-backed `keyvalue` state into the record store (see
 * apps/workspace/src/records.ts and docs/app-data.md) and deletes the files.
 *
 * Before this, `keyvalue` lived as ordinary workspace files:
 *   - workspace calls:  .services/keyvalue/<key>
 *   - app sessions:     <app root>/data/<userSub>/<key>            (owner-hosted)
 *                        <install prefix>/data/<key>                (workspace-scoped install — no
 *                                                                     per-user folder; see caveat below)
 *   - Personal (every workspace's built-in app): .personal/data/<userSub>/<key>
 *
 * The gateway's read path (services.ts `keyvalue`) already migrates lazily,
 * per key, on next read — this script does the same thing eagerly, for every
 * key in every workspace, so nothing is left stranded on the file plane
 * waiting for a read that may never come, and `apps.data` (owner-side
 * admin visibility) has something to show immediately.
 *
 * A record-store HIT for a key is left alone (a live write already won the
 * race — this script never overwrites fresher data with a stale file).
 * Every migrated file is deleted after a successful write to the record
 * store. Dry-run by default: prints what it *would* do without touching
 * anything; pass --execute to actually write/delete.
 *
 * CAVEAT — `dataScope: "workspace"` installs: the old FS layout stored an
 * installed app's data in one shared file per key (`<prefix>/data/<key>`,
 * no per-user folder — "the workspace is the user"), because the old
 * `keyvalue` implementation's `appDataDir` collapsed to the install prefix
 * itself for `dataScope: "workspace"`. The record store's scope is always
 * `app#<name>#u#<callingUserSub>` regardless of `dataScope` (see
 * docs/app-data.md — only the *tenant* varies with `dataScope`, never the
 * scope shape), so there is no way to recover which member's calls produced
 * that shared file. This script migrates it into a placeholder scope keyed
 * by the workspace id itself (`app#<name>#u#<workspaceId>`) so the value
 * isn't lost, but a fresh call from a real user afterwards will land in
 * THEIR OWN scope, not this placeholder — the old cross-member sharing
 * within one install does not carry forward. Flagged loudly in the log.
 *
 * Usage (from the repo root):
 *   pnpm -C apps/workspace exec tsx scripts/migrate-app-records.ts                 # dry run (default)
 *   pnpm -C apps/workspace exec tsx scripts/migrate-app-records.ts --execute        # actually migrate
 *   pnpm -C apps/workspace exec tsx scripts/migrate-app-records.ts --workspace <id> # limit to one workspace
 *
 * Do NOT run with --execute against prd without a deliberate, reviewed pass —
 * this walks and deletes files across every workspace.
 *
 * Environment: same knobs as the workspace itself (WORKSPACE_MODE, DYNAMO_ENDPOINT,
 * S3_ENDPOINT, FS_BUCKET, FS_TABLE, RECORDS_TABLE, DYNAMODB_WORKSPACES_TABLE,
 * AWS_REGION / credentials) — point it at the same backend the gateway runs
 * against.
