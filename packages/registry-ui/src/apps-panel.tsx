/**
 * AppsPanel — the shared surface for Apps and Workflows, rendered identically
 * by the registry web app (`/registry/apps`) and by patchwork chat.
 *
 * Why this replaces the flat WorkflowsPanel: an app is a *bundle* — pages plus
 * an export list of workflows plus an allow-list, a data scope and an auth
 * boundary — and a workspace accumulates far more of both than a single flat
 * list can carry. So the panel is master/detail. The master column groups by
 * app, all the way down: every workflow belongs to one, and the ones nothing
 * exports belong to the workspace's implicit **Personal** app (a first-class
 * group, not a "Workspace" catch-all — there is no such thing anymore). It
 * filters, and it renders a capped window with a "show more" tail so hundreds
 * of entries stay usable without a virtualiser dependency. The detail column
 * is the app (Overview / Workflows / Access / Releases / Versions) or the
 * workflow (the TailorFlow graph, run form, run history, trace, and the
 * cascade tree when the run fanned out).
 *
 * Transport-agnostic, exactly like the panel it replaces: the host supplies
 * `invoke(operation, args)` for the gateway's `workflows` namespace and
 * `invokeApps(operation, args)` for `apps` (POST /tools/<namespace>/<op>).
 * Nothing here fetches. Everything here is defensive about the response: the
 * gateway grows `capabilities`, `channels`, `releases`, `promote`, `rollback`
 * and `tree` on its own schedule, and a procedure that isn't there yet makes
 * its section go quiet rather than breaking the panel.
 *
 * Compact mode: `variant="sidebar"` (or the {@link AppsExplorer} alias)
 * renders only the grouped list, collapsible per app, sized for a 288px chat
 * sidebar, with counts, last-run status dots, an inline run and an "Open"
 * affordance per row. It is the *same component and state* as the full
 * panel's master column — not a fork — so the two surfaces can never drift.
 *
 * What the host owns, because a shared panel cannot guess it:
 *
 * - **Height.** `fill` switches `variant="full"` from the standalone page's
 *   `70vh` cap to filling a pane the host already sized. A `className` the
 *   host passes wins over the panel's own layout classes (see `mergeClasses`).
 * - **Expansion.** Groups open by size rather than by variant, and
 *   `expandedGroups` / `onExpandedGroupsChange` let a host persist the state.
 * - **One catalog per page.** Two surfaces mounted at once (chat has both)
 *   share a single load and a single `refresh` under {@link AppsCatalogProvider}.
 * - **Deletion.** `onSelectionRemoved` separates "the user deselected" from
 *   "the thing is gone", which is the difference between keeping a tab and
 *   closing it.
