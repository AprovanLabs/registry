/**
 * Wire types and defensive normalisers for the Apps / Workflows surfaces.
 *
 * Moved to `@aprovan/ui/apps-store` (2026-07-24) so the data plane is shared
 * with any other host that renders an Apps surface, not just this package.
 * This file re-exports the same names so registry-ui's own modules — which
 * import `./wire` throughout — never had to change, and so a consumer that
 * (still) imports `@aprovan/registry-ui/apps-panel` sees the identical
 * exported type and function set it always has.
